## Background
In order to address the potential depression/mental problem for university students, HappyJai is a mobile application designed for students to visualize their level of everyday happiness, and to let them realize whether are they in a healthy mental state.
We provide a forum, with chatrooms and direct messaging for students to communicate with their schoolmates and the AI in HappyJai will analyze communication data of every user and calculate their rate of happiness.
